                    <p>
                        EcoData is a community of students who solve environmental and community problems with the innovative use of interdisciplinary knowledge, technology, and data sciences. As a member of the Web Development team, I am working with peers to redesign and code a new website for the club that prioritizes UX/UI principles. As a member of the Data Visualizations Ssubteam, I am working on two mini-projects. The first is a collaboration with BLUELab Metro — another University of Michigan organization that plants trees around campus — to calculate potential carbon offset from the tree growth over time and create a visualization and predictive model. The second is a collaboration with Pingree Farms, an urban farm in Detroit, to create an interactive map of the farm and a visualization of their food distribution to help analyze their community impact.

                    <p>
                        I lead students through Writing To Learn assignments by hosting office hours, monitoring Piazza (question forum), facilitating a peer review process, and providing feedback to students on their work. I then grade student responses in a fair and timely manner in order to support the STATS 250 staff.

                        Circle K is an international service organization sponsored by Kiwanis International that focuses on three tenets: service, fellowship, and leadership. As a technology committee member, I work with my committee lead to upkeep the MCircle K club website, which facilitates service event sign-ups and announcements. As a general member, I participate in 6 hours of community service per month.

                    <p>
                        MProduct is a campus community for students passionate about building great products and learning more about the product management field. As a member, I participate in workshops, panels, and speaker events with product managers from around the country to learn about real-life work experiences. I also participate in product discussions and analyses throughout the semester and have worked with club members to create a digital product prototype.

                    <p>
                        I greeted customers enthusiastically while taking and filling bakery orders in collaboration with my co-workers. I took special care to learn product descriptions and formulate genuine recommendations so that I could provide exemplary customer service. Lastly, I took the initiative to inform the owner about a company called Too Good To Go, which works to reduce food waste. We brainstormed how to partner with them, and Floriole now utilizes Too Good To Go’s services daily.
