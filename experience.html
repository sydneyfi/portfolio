                        This summer I will be identifying societal implications of technological advancements with two researchers at the School of Information, Dr. Matthew Bui and PhD candidate Alex Lu. I will be analyzing restaurateurs of colors’ digital presentation with a lens of authenticity, visibility, and algorithmic bias through Yelp API scraping, web design, GIS visualization, and qualitative interviews and examining the ramifications of the Detroit Police Department’s Project Green Light on Southeast Michigan through survey administration and community conversations with Eastside Community Network.
